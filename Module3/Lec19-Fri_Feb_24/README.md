# Topics:
* [Action Items](#action-items)
* [UML Class Diagrams](#uml-class-diagrams)
* [What is the point of a UML Class Diagram?](#what-is-the-point-of-a-uml-class-diagram)


------------------------------------------------------------
# Action Items

*   Complete phases **4. Deployment** and **5. Maintenance** *today* 
    *   Make your final push to GitLab early so you have plenty of time to **verify** your submission
*	Call on 2 designated questioners
*	Hold a 3-minute stand-up scrum meeting with your team



# [UML Class Diagrams](../UML.md)

The Unified Modeling Language is an important design-phase tool that helps you
capture the essence of an object-oriented system.  Creating a UML class diagram
early on will support your work in the later phases of the project, especially
the Implementation phase.



# [What is the point of a UML Class Diagram?](../UML.md#what-am-i-trying-to-accomplish-with-a-uml-class-diagram)


What sorts of things can I say in the Unified Modeling Language?

*   High-level structure of a system
*   Ways in which classes/objects in a system are related to each other
*   How many objects participate in a relationship

What do I expect you to accomplish with UML?

*   Explain *what* classes exist in your solution
    *   Describe the starter code so as to help you understand it
    *   Show me how the starter code classes have changed in your implementation
    *   Show me any new classes that you created

The goal of Assignment #4 is to ensure that, for at least once in your career, you have the experience of designing an object-oriented system *before* you sit down to code it, as opposed to documenting it after the fact.
