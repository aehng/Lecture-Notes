# Using the Text Tools with Assignment #3

You have created your own text processing tools, which increases your power as a programmer in three ways:

0.  You have a suite of useful commands that help you process large amounts of text more easily than with an interactive text editor
1.  You have gained valuable knowledge about how to process textual data; you'll find that many software engineering tasks boil down to processing text
2.  You have gained confidence because you now know that you can create your own command-line tools

You can use your own text tools to get a handle on your next assignment.  Or, you can use the text tools that come with your shell.  Each of the commands that `tt.py` takes corresponds to a classic Unix text-processing program.  These programs have more options than yours, and are likely faster.

On the other hand, your Text Tools have the advantage of being flexible: you can add to or change them as the need arises.  For this reason you should make them available for use anywhere on your system.  If you haven't already done this, review [How to install your Text Tools](./Installing_the_Text_Tools.md)
