*	Hold a 3-minute stand-up scrum meeting with your team



# [What kinds of programming languages are there?](../Paradigms/README.md)

The problem that programming languages solve is "how do I get this dumb machine
to follow my instructions?" Programming languages exist to bridge the gap
between your mind and a machine, enabling you to explain to a CPU *what* to do
and *how* to do it.

The reason why there are so many different programming languages is because
there are many, many ways to solve this problem.
