# Structured Programming

*   [Structured.py](./Structured.py)


Related code is collected into unnamed blocks which may be skipped or repeated.

This paradigm intends to rein in the tendency towards "Spaghetti Code" that
prevails under the Imperative style.  This is the paradigm which champions the
advice "never use GOTOs" or "Go To Statement Considered Harmful".

Structured code is divided into blocks of instructions which may be entered
only from the top.  Blocks may be skipped or repeated based upon the result of
evaluating a boolean expression called a "conditional".  Structured programming
blocks include:

* If/Then/Else statements
* Switch or Case statements
* For(each) loops
* While/until loops

Examples: ALGOL, PL/I, Pascal, C/C++/C#, Java, Python


## Who said that letters to the editor don't make a difference?

The popularity of structured programming arises from a letter written by Dr. Edsger Dijkstra to the ACM in March 1968.  While Dr. Dijkstra didn't invent the concept, his controversial letter raised its profile.

In addition to ushering a new programming paradigm, the title of this letter
(which was actually chosen by another giant of Computer Science, Niklaus Wirth,
who was the editor of *Communications of the ACM* at the time) became a meme in
CS.  There are dozens of other articles with titles of the form **X Considered
Harmful**.

This is a link to a 4-page PDF, of which Dr. Dijkstra's letter is the first
post and is little over one page long.  This is an important piece of Computer
Science history, so you should spend 2 minutes and read it!
