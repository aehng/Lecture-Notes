# Object-Oriented Programming

*   [OOP.py](./OOP.py)
    Main entry-point to the OOP FizzBuzz program
*   [FizzBuzz.py](./FizzBuzz.py)
    FizzBuzz class that creates FizzBuzz stream objects.  A FizzBuzz stream
    object is constructed to cover a range of integers and can be asked to
    provide the next number in the sequence.  The FizzBuzz stream object keeps
    track of its place within the sequence so your code doesn't have to.


Beginning with primitive data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.,
an object-oriented programmer creates new composite data types called
'classes'.  The 'type' of a piece of data defines which operations may be
performed on the data.  By introducing new data types the programmer can extend
the expressiveness of the programming language.

Classes represent collections of related data representing some important
aspect of the solution.  As the program runs instances of classes are created
and are called 'objects'.

Far from being inert collections of bits and bytes, objects are regarded as
being active participants in that they can act and react to events within the
system.  This is because the functions which are to operate upon the data
contained within the objects become part of the object itself, imbuing it with
active potential.  Conceptually, the "same" operation might do different
things, depending on the classes of the data it is being applied to.

Put another way, the Object-Oriented approach is to classify data which exists
in the system, organize this data into discrete and distinct units which also
contain code expressing the operations which work upon this data.

Examples: Smalltalk, Java, C++, C#, Python
