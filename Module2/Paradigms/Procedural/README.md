# Procedural programming

*   [Procedural.py](./Procedural.py)


Related code is collected into named procedures which can only be entered from
the top.
  
The fundamental unit of code is a named sequence of instructions called a
"procedure".  You can think of procedure as a synonym for "function", though in
some programming languages there is a distinction between these two terms;
functions can return a value while procedures do not.  Other synonyms for
procedure include:

* (sub)routine
* subprogram

A procedure cannot be entered midway through as with a `jump` or `goto`
instruction.  Control begins at the top of the procedure and proceeds toward
its end.  Though a procedure has only one starting point, it may have multiple
exit points.

Examples: C, FORTRAN, Pascal
