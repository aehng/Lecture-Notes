# Modular

*   [Modular.py](./Modular.py)
    FizzBuzz program split across many modules
*   [Modules/](./Modules)
    One module for the `main()` code, one to detect 'fizz' numbers, and another
    responsible for 'buzz' numbers.


Related pieces of code are collected into larger entities called 'Modules'.
Modules may or may not be useful by themselves, but most often a module is
*not* a complete, standalone program.

Modules may be selectively included into a useful program.  Modules encourage
code reuse by enabling libraries of commonly desired general-purpose code to be
readily available.

Many languages incorporate this concept under various names, such as modules,
packages, imports, gems, eggs, shared objects, header files, etc.

Examples: Modula, Java, Python, C/C++/C#
