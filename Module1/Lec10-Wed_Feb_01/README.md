# [Debugging](../Debugging.md)

The process of finding software errors (the causes of failures) and then correcting those errors.

> If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
>
> -- Edsger W. Dijkstra

This lecture presents a lot of information in rapid succession.  I don't expect you to remember all of this right now.  Jot brief notes about topics that you want to pursue later and **bookmark** the above link for your reference.



# [Ten Cool Debugging Tricks That Will Impress Your Friends](../Debugging.md#ten-cool-debugging-tricks-that-will-impress-your-friends)

If these tricks don't impress your friends, get better friends.



# [How to Debug Anything in Four Easy Steps](../Debugging.md#how-to-debug-anything-in-four-easy-steps)

Maybe the word *easy* is a little misleading.  Following these steps is the easy part, but actually locating a bug may not be.



# Rubber Duck Debugging

You knew this was coming.

# [The "Wolf Fence" Algorithm for Finding Bugs](../Debugging.md#the-wolf-fence-algorithm-for-finding-bugs)

How do you find a wolf in Alaska?  I hope you got a building permit...



# [How to Read a Stack Trace](../Debugging.md#how-to-read-a-stack-trace)

The wall of text that your program screams at you on its way out may trigger memories of a bad break-up and make you want to shut down.  But if you value your time, don't curl up into a ball and wait for it to leave.
