# Retrospective: Assignment #1

**A Ha & Oh No! Moments**

Come get two sticky notes, one of each color.  On each note write down your A# and

*   **On a `#FF00FF` pink sticky note** a moment that made you say 'A Ha!'
*   **On a `#FFFF00` yellow sticky note** a moment that made you say 'Oh no!'

Post them on the whiteboard along the timeline of Assignment #1 (Jan 18 - Jan 26) indicating when that event occurred to you.



*   What was the single biggest problem for the class?
    *   **Procrastination**, judging by the distribution of sticky notes
*   What was the most beneficial thing that happened to the class?
    *   Reading the starter code - saves time b/c some of the assignment is already written for us
    *   Carefully designing pseudocode in Phase 2 shortens amount of work needed in Phase 3
*   What is one thing that you will **begin doing** for Assignment 2?
    *   Read everything, including the starter code!
*   What is one thing that you will **stop doing** for Assignment 2?
    *   Procrastinating!

# Assignment #1 Code ~~Review~~ Roast

*If your code is featured, please take it in the spirit of constructive criticism*


## Lightning round - amusing imports brought to you by your IDE

These students are just lucky that these imports didn't cause their code to crash.


*   Forbidden imports receive a 10 point penalty.
    *   These students will be asked to fix these for a chance to reduce the penalty somewhat (but not erase it).
*   Review your imports as part of Phase 4
    *   Once the due date passes you cannot fix them for free!
