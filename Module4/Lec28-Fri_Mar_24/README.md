# [How will I know when to refactor?](../Refactoring.md#how-will-i-know-when-to-refactor)

If software is "grown" and not "built", then refactoring is pruning.

There are two answers to this question:

0.  If you are a **developer** the answer is *"whenever I find a code smell"*
1.  If you are a **project manager** the answer is *"whenever we can afford it"*, which is another way of saying *"never"*



# [Should I refactor *and* add functionality at the same time?](../Refactoring.md#should-i-refactor-and-add-functionality-at-the-same-time)

**No!**
