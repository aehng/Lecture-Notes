# Get to know your professor

Hi, I'm Erik Falor, and I'm your professor this semester.

My family got our first computer for Christmas in 1994, when I was in eighth grade.  I always thought of myself as being "good with computers", but I didn't begin seriously programming until my second year of college when I was 21.  I was originally a Communications major because I debated and worked on the newspaper in High School.  I was not then, nor am I now, mathematically inclined.  Compared to my CS classmates I had a late start getting into programming, and I felt like I had to do a lot of catching up to get even with where they were.

I earned my Bachelor's in CS and worked as a software engineer for 13 years at Spillman Technologies, Inc. (now Motorola Solutions) and Automated Products Group.  In 2011 I joined the USU Master's program as a part-time remote student, and graduated fall 2016.  I taught a class as an adjunct the following spring semester, and loved it.  I have been teaching full-time since fall 2017.


I spent my programming career:

*   _Reading_ horrible documentation
*   _Writing_ documentation that was, hopefully, an improvement
*   _Maintaining_ software that was first written **way** before my time.  Some of the oldest code I touched was first written in the early 90's, while I was still in elementary school.
    *   _Testing_ code written by myself and teammates
    *   _Finding_ and fixing bugs
    *   _Monitoring_ the performance of our software on customers' systems
    *   _Porting_ software between platforms
*   _Building_ software with build systems such as Make, Ant, VisualStudio, IAR Embedded Workbench and shell scripts
*   _Reviewing_ code written by my team
*   _Processed_ data with SQL & ISAM databases, XML/XSLT, the Unix text tools and tools that I made myself
*   _Designing_ new software
    *   _Writing_ new code in Perl, C, C++, Java/C#, XSLT and Shell

There is no such thing as a "stupid question" in my classroom...

...though some questions are not germane to the lecture.  I'm always happy to stay after class to answer off-topic questions.



# You're hired!

Welcome to DuckieCorp, the consultancy firm for programmers who talk to themselves.

The purpose of this course is to prepare you to become a competent problem-solver who understands and uses the best software engineering techniques.


*   Course structure 
    *   [Topics covered in this course](../../Outline_of_Topics.md)
    *   These on-line lecture notes are your textbook

        -   A filled-out Software Development Plan is a **required part of each assignment**
        -   Don't write any code at the beginning - make sure you first understand what the assignment is about
    *   You *may* design & brainstorm with study buddies
    *   You *must* write your code individually
        *   *Do not* submit code you saw on Chegg, CourseHero, Stack Overflow, YouTube, the CS Discord, etc.
    *   Submit to GitLab only; there nothing to turn in on Canvas
    *   After you submit your code, complete the **Assignment Reflection Quiz** for 5 points

# [What CS 1440 is about](../../What_CS_1440_Is_About.md)

CS 1440 is **fundamentally different** than CS 1400.  This document helps you set the right expectations.



# Problem-Solving Activity: When will you find time to sleep?

Getting a college degree is a **lot** of work.  But exactly how much work are you in for?  Can you afford to have a job, a social life, or even to sleep?

After all of this hard work, you should be able to call yourself an expert in your field, right?

Since I am a programmer, my instinct is to write a program to figure this out.  But every time I dive straight in and write code, I get stuck.  A better way is to first *design* the program in my mind before I commit it to [code](./effort.py)

Let's find answers to these questions in particular:

*   How many hours per week will I need to spend on classes?
    *   ...
*   How many hours per week can I sleep?
    *   ...
*   How many hours per week can go towards a job?
    *   ...
*   How many hours of free time can I afford per week?
    *   ...
*   How many hours of my Bachelor's degree actually go towards becoming a programmer (or your intended profession)?
    *   ...
*   How close to a 10k-hour "Gladwell Expert" will I be upon graduation?
    *   ...
