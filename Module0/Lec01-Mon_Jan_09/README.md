<summary><b>Section 001</b> Hi, I'm Joseph Ditton, and I'm your professor this semester. </summary>

**BIO GOES HERE**

<summary><b>Section 002</b> Hi, I'm Erik Falor, and I'm your professor this semester. </summary>

I graduated from USU with a Master's degree in Fall 2016 and have been teaching
here ever since.  Before that, I worked as a software engineer for 13 years at
Spillman Technologies, Inc. (now Motorola Solutions) and Automated Products
Group.

I spent my programming career:

*   _Reading_ horrible documentation
*   _Writing_ documentation that was, hopefully, an improvement
*   _Maintaining_ software that was first written **way** before my time.  Some of the oldest code I touched was first written in the early 90's, while I was still in elementary school.
    *   _Testing_ code written by myself and teammates
    *   _Finding_ and fixing bugs
    *   _Monitoring_ the performance of our software on customers' systems
    *   _Porting_ software between platforms
*   _Building_ software with build systems such as Make, Ant, VisualStudio, IAR Embedded Workbench and shell scripts
*   _Reviewing_ code written by my team
*   _Processed_ data with SQL & ISAM databases, XML/XSLT, the Unix text tools and tools that I made myself
*   _Designing_ new software
    *   _Writing_ new code in Perl, C, C++, Java/C#, XSLT and Shell

This document is already *required* in this course, and it is necessary if you want their help.  The TAs and I will also ask for your plan when you come to us for help about assignments.
