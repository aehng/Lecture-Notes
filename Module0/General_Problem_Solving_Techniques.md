## 0.  ![Always Have a Plan](./assets/0.always_have_a_plan.png) **Always Have a Plan**
*   Look for patterns in the problem.
*   Identify the resources that you will turn to when stuck:
    *   Documentation, both on-line and off
    *   People
    *   Your prior work
    *   Tools and programs
*   A plan gives you a sense of progress; it feels good to cross off
    completed items.
*   With a plan you can see when you are getting stuck.
*   A plan is not set in stone; it should change as you go.


## 1.  ![Divide the Problem](./assets/1.divide_the_problem.png) **Divide the Problem**
*   Break it into do-able chunks.
*   Identify subtasks within the problem.
    *   Most problems naturally contain smaller sub-problems.
*   Solving these smaller pieces gives a sense of progress.


## 2.  ![Start with What You Know](./assets/2.start_with_what_you_know.png) **Start with What You Know**
*   Begin with the easiest sub-problems.
    *   Decide the order in which they must be addressed.
    *   Save the unknowns for later.
*   Often the solutions to the sub-problems you can grasp will unlock your
    understanding of the trickier ones.


## 3.  ![Restate the Problem](./assets/3.restate_the_problem.png) **Restate the Problem**
*   A.K.A. The [Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkm0TNFzIeg).
*   Translate the problem into your own words.
*   Explain the problem to yourself, your rubber duckie, or a 5-year-old
    (ELI5).
    *   You will notice features or constraints which weren't apparent
        before.
    *   If you are able to put the problem into your own words you know
        that you have a good understanding.
    *   When you can't do this you have identified a place that needs more
        careful study.


## 4.  ![Look for Analogies](./assets/4.look_for_analogies.png) **Look for Analogies**
*   Perhaps you have already solved a problem that is similar to this.
*   As you write more programs and solve more problems you increase your
    abilities.
    *   Keep an inventory of your code.  You never know when that program
        you wrote *N* years ago will come in handy!
    *   Study programming techniques, algorithms and data structures.  In
        time you will have seen *everything*.


## 5.  ![Reduce the Problem](./assets/5.reduce_the_problem.png) **Reduce the Problem**
*   The problem is not truly as big as it first appears.
*   Reduce the amount of ground you need to cover.
    *   Put constraints on the problem to rule out possibilities.
    *   What inputs can be ruled out and blocked from entering the program?
    *   What outcomes are impossible/nonsensical?
*   This is the difference between a na√Øve brute-force approach and an
    elegant solution.


## 6.  ![Experiment](./assets/6.experiment.png) **Experiment**
*   Be willing to try different approaches.
*   Don't become too invested in any one approach; you may need to throw it out
    and start again.
*   Python is a *great* language for experimentation because you can quickly
    write a prototype without much investment.
    *   Use the **REPL** to quickly try new things out.


## 7.  ![Don't get Frustrated](./assets/7.dont_get_frustrated.png) **Don't get Frustrated**
*   If you have properly broken up the problem and are following a plan,
    you can avoid feeling lost in a trackless wasteland with no sense of
    direction or progress.
*   Put your downtime to work!  Take breaks when you are feeling stuck and
    switch to another task.
    *   How often have you found the answer you are looking for while in the
        shower or driving home from work?
    *   You can't do this if you are a procrastinator.  Today is a good day to break the cycle!
