![./02-bsides-logo.png]

I hope to see you there!


## Free Software and Linux Club

*   **What**  Ruling the Modern  Web With Free and Open Source Software
*   **When**  6:30pm Thursday, April 13th
*   **Where** ESLC 053, [FSLC Discord server](https://discord.gg/GKWhbVDN38)
*   **Streaming** https://linux.usu.edu/streams

The presentation will be by Simponic on the current state of the modern web - from the perspective of the general user in addition to that of us developers (including those looking to get started). We'll discover how Free Software can be used to mitigate a lot of the webs' problems, and its role in increasing user choice, privacy, and security. I will also be showing a simple application as it would have been developed through the ages of the internet, to get a good understanding of how we got here. Maybe a little bit of NGINX RTMP stuff if there's time, since I've picked up there's some interest in that and how it's setup for the club.

# [Exception Best-Practices](../Exceptions.md#exception-best-practices)

Follow these guidelines for best results



# [Exceptions in Python](../Exceptions.md#exceptions-in-python)

You've already been taking advantage of exceptions.  By allowing functions such as `open()` to crash your programs you are letting Python do the work of reporting errors in your code.
