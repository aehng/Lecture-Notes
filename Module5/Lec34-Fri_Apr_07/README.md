# The [Factory Method Pattern](../Design_Patterns.md#the-factory-method-pattern)

The idea of the Factory Method design pattern is to separate the *location of creation* from the choice of *what* to create.

See the completed [Sequences](./Sequences) demo for an example of this pattern



# [The Strategy Pattern](../Design_Patterns.md#the-strategy-pattern)
